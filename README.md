# Enhanced Clinical Trial Search Engine

## Project Overview
This project presents a novel approach to improving clinical trial searches by integrating advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and a comprehensive Knowledge Base. The primary goal is to enhance the precision and relevance of clinical trial retrieval, harnessing the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. By combining the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs with the structured information of a Knowledge Base, this system sets a new standard in medical research technology.

## Core Features
- **Advanced Patient Summary Interpretation**: Utilizes LLMs to deeply understand and process patient summaries, ensuring a more accurate match between patient needs and clinical trial offerings.
- **Enhanced Data Matching with Knowledge Base**: A structured Knowledge Base is employed to align trial data with patient information, improving the relevance and accuracy of search results.
- **Innovative IR and NLP Techniques**: The project employs cutting-edge techniques in IR and NLP to refine the search process, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

## Repository Structure
### Notebooks
- `Clinical_Trial_Search_Engine.ipynb`: Main notebook demonstrating the integration of LLM and Knowledge Base for trial searches.
- `Data_Visualization_and_Analysis.ipynb`: Analysis of the data involved in the project, with visualizations.
- `Knowledge_Base_Construction.ipynb`: Details the process of building and utilizing the Knowledge Base.
- `Search_Query_Optimization.ipynb`: Focuses on optimizing search queries for better results.

### Documentation
- `IR_Report.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the project's objectives, methodology, and outcomes.
- `Presentation_Group1.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project highlights and findings.

## Installation and Usage
To set up and use this project, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone [repository URL]` to clone the project to your local machine.
2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed. Create a virtual environment (`python -m venv venv`) and activate it.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in the repository).
4. **Running the Notebooks**: Open the Jupyter notebooks in an IDE or JupyterLab. Execute the cells in sequence to understand the workflow and the logic behind each step.
5. **Data Files:** If the project requires external data files, download them and place them in the specified directory (provide instructions on where to find these files and where to place them).

## Contributing
I welcome and value your contributions. If you're looking to contribute to this project, here are the steps:
1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by creating a fork of the main repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Work on a new branch in your forked repository. This helps in keeping the main project separate from your changes.
3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature or bug fix. 
4. **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.
5. **Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to the main repository with your changes for review.
6. **Code Review**: Wait for the project maintainers to review your submission. They may request some changes or improvements before merging your contribution.

Special thanks to my colleagues Mattia Moro and Capalbo Lorenzo, and our mentor Prof. Georgos Peikos, for their invaluable contributions to this project.
