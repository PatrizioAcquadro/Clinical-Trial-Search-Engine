# Enhanced Clinical Trial Search Engine

## Project Overview
This project represents a cutting-edge fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Bases to redefine the search and retrieval of clinical trial data. It addresses the challenges in medical information retrieval by integrating advanced NLP techniques with a comprehensive Knowledge Base, streamlining the process of finding relevant clinical trials.

## Core Components
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Utilized for in-depth analysis and interpretation of patient summaries, enhancing the search precision.
- **Knowledge Base**: A meticulously structured database that improves data matching and retrieval effectiveness in clinical trials.

## Repository Structure
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing our methodology, including data analysis, LLM integration, and Knowledge Base construction.
- **Documentation**: Contains the detailed project report and presentations, outlining our approach and findings.

## Getting Started
